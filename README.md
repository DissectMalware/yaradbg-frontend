# Introduction
YaraDbg is a free web-based Yara debugger to help security analysts to write hunting or detection rules with less effort and more confidence. By using YaraDbg, you can perform a thorough root-cause-analysis (RCA) on why some of your Yara rules did or did not match with a specific file. It can also help you to better maintain a large set of yara rules.

YaraDbg frontend, this project, is the frontend application for YaraDbg (live on: https://yaradbg.dev). If you are interested on the backend implementation visit [YaraDbg Backend](https://github.com/DissectMalware/yaradbg-backend) project.
